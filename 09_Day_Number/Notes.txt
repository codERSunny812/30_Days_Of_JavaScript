javascript number are always 64 bit floating points

all number are stored as 64 bit floating point number.


This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63:



the maximun  number of digit stored is 17 in decimal

the javascript interpreter work from left to the right

javascript can also  have numeric strings.

EPSILON	--> The difference between 1 and the smallest number > 1.
MAX_VALUE -->	The largest number possible in JavaScript
MIN_VALUE -->	The smallest number possible in JavaScript
MAX_SAFE_INTEGER  -->	The maximum safe integer (253 - 1)
MIN_SAFE_INTEGER -->	The minimum safe integer -(253 - 1)
POSITIVE_INFINITY -->	Infinity (returned on overflow)
NEGATIVE_INFINITY -->	Negative infinity (returned on overflow)
NaN --> 	A "Not-a-Number" value
